1. Unless you like fiddling with your adress bar all the time, apply the ‚ÄúTequila Bugware‚Äù ¬ß below

To be done every time:
- Be in EPNET (VPN or on-site at EPFL)
- To start things, say <pre>make up</pre>
- To stop things, say <pre>make down<pre>
- To start over (including destroying and recreating the database content), say <pre>make rinse</pre>

üí° You can also combine multiple `make` commands, e.g. <pre>make rinse up</pre>
